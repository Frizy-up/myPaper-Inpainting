% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEE_lsens.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


% The textcomp package can be loaded to get better \textcopyright and
% \textregistered symbols (as is used in the footer of the title page
% of LSENS papers).
\usepackage{textcomp}






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[noadjust]{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% for line art (i.e., plots, graphs, etc.) as they result in 
% "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as well as large
% increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % optional enhanced font encoding
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath

\usepackage[cmintegrals]{newtxmath}
% A Times compatible math font is required for IEEE Sensors Letters.
% Michael Sharpe's freely available newtxmath package (version 1.451,
% July 28, 2015 or later) is recommended. The cmintegrals option, which
% IEEE_lsens sets as a default upon loading newtxmath, is/was needed to
% obtain the specific style of integral symbol used by the IEEE Sensors
% Letters. However, as of version 1.5 of the newtxmath package, released
% on 2016/08/12, the correct integral symbol is now invoked by default
% and the cmintegrals option is no longer needed and is silently ignored.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
\usepackage{bm}
% support for selective bold math 
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bm




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEE_lsens.cls
% handling of captions.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basic use: \url{my_url_here}.
%
%
% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
\newcommand\MYhyperrefoptions{hypertexnames=true, bookmarks=true,

% allow hyperref to be unloaded without have to delete any apprearances
% of these commands in the document.
\providecommand{\hypersetup}[1]{\relax}
\providecommand{\texorpdfstring}[2]{#1}
%
% We use \hypersetup instead of the package options for the
% PDF strings because there is a problem with using underscores
% with the package option approach. Also, the info that needs
% to be changed is all here.

%
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to change/add the option for
% hypertexnames=false if you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but
% this should not be needed in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:

\begin{abstract}
Multi-views systems have been widely used in robots, ADAS(Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), monitor systems and so on, using multi-views, the machine can better perceive the surrounding scenes. The exposed lens and the camera are easily contaminated by the outside, resulting in abnormal images. Image inpainting technology can utilize the prior information of the image structure, texture and other information provided by the surrounding pixels of the abnormal area to recover the damaged image, which can reduce the loss of visual information, providing as much information as possible for the machine's decisions. In order to achieve the above purposes, considering the characteristics of multi-vision system, a novel image inpainting method is proposed. The basic idea is that using conditional generative adversarial networks(CGAN) to amend defect images, in which the priori condition is the synchronization frame from other cameras in different viewpoints. The generator in the CGAN is a autoencoder which has skip connected from encoder to decoder. We also integrate spatial transform networks, group convolution and channel switching technology in our network structure to better fusion the multi-views information. Experimental results show the advantage of our method.

\section{Introduction}

Image inpainting means to restore the defective image according to the image texture, structure and other information. It has been broad applied in many field, such as defect images restoration\cite{Efros1999::Texture,Lu2010::Novel}, video communication error repairing\cite{Rane2002::Wavelet,Rane2003:IToIP:Structure} and photo editing\cite{Bertalmio2000::Image,Shih2005::Digital}. With the development of image and video processing technology, visual information has played a key role in the field  of automation. Due to the limited information available from monocular cameras, the multi-views system is widely used. Fig \ref{fig:VehicleWithFourCameras} 
\begin{figure*}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{self_driver_top_view}
\caption{A vehicle equipped with four cameras(Cam0\texttildelow Cam3).}
\label{fig:VehicleWithFourCameras}
\end{figure*}
show a typical multi-views system --- a vehicle equipped with four cameras to detection objects\cite{Geiger2012::Are}. Some reasons easily cause abnormal images. First, the camera lens were blocked by rain, snow or mosquitoes; Second, losing some information in the process of image signal compression, transmission and decompression. When the autonomous vehicles are running and these unexpected things happened, would lead to traffic accidents. In order to automatically restore the abnormal images on driving, we propose a novel image inpainting method based on multi-views. Our method can be used on other multi-views systems.

Image inpainting has made tremendous progress in the past nearly two decades. Many methods has been proposed which can be divided into two groups. The first set of approaches relies on texture synthesis techniques, which fills in the hole by extending the textures of the surrounding area\cite{Efros1999::Texture,Drori2003::Fragment,Wilczkowiak2005::Hole,Barnes2009:AToG:PatchMatch:}. What these techniques have in common is the use of patches with similar textures to synthesize the content of the hole region from coarse to fine. Drori et al.\cite{Drori2003::Fragment} and Wilczkowiak et al.\cite{Wilczkowiak2005::Hole} introduced multiple scales and orientations to find better matching patches. Barnes et al.\cite{Barnes2009:AToG:PatchMatch:} used the fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithm to search the match patches.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% The IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first/title page for that matter. In addition, IEEE
% Sensors Letters typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in an entire column being occupied by floats. Also, in-text
% middle ("here") positioning is not used. 
%
% Double column floats (i.e., \begin{figure*}, \begin{table*}) should
% not appear on the very first (title) or last pages of IEEE Sensors Letters
% papers.
%
% Also note that IEEE Sensors Letters uses the naming convention of
% fig1.eps, fig2a.pdf, etc., for submitted graphics files.

% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,

%\label{fig_lossrate}
%\end{figure}
% Note that IEEE Sensors Letters usually only labels the subfigures

% With subfig.sty, you still have to invoke the option argument
% (subfig caption) of \subfloat[]{} to get the (a), (b) labels, even if
% the subfig caption/description itself is empty.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. The \label must come after \caption as always.

This work was supported by the IEEE. The authors would
like to thank ... Note that the Acknowledgment section of
\textit{IEEE Sensors Letters} is rendered in scriptsize.

% put at least one blank line to end the scriptsize paragraph and
% then revert back to normalsize.

% Last page column equalization
%
% IEEE Sensors Letters does balance the columns on the last page.
% Can use:
% \IEEEtriggeratref{8}
% to trigger a \newpage just before the given reference number to
% balance the columns on the last page. Adjust the reference number
% as needed - this may need to be readjusted if the document is 
% modified later.
% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%\IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-5in}}
%
% Alternatively, you can also directly use something like
% \enlargethispage{-7in}
% on the last page instead of breaking at a specific reference number.
